.. _Overview:

Overview
========

The Main Telescope Active Optics System (MTAOS) Commandable SAL Component (CSC) is operating the closed-loop optical system.
MTAOS calculates the wavefront error based on defocal images obtained with corner raft wavefront sensor, estimates the optical state, and sends the correction in the forms of bending modes and rigid body positions to the mirrors and hexapods.
DDS/SAL (Service Abstraction Layer) is used to send commands from MTAOS to M1M3 static support and M2 hexapod.

In automatic operations, MTAOS will be controlled by the Telescope Control System (TCS) to do the closed-loop correction.
MTAOS is part of the `Main Telescope Control Packages <https://obs-controls.lsst.io/System-Architecture/Control-Packages/index.html>`_.
The backbone of CSC is using the `ts_salobj <https://ts-salobj.lsst.io>`_ library, which defines the state transitions.
The summary state machine is defined in `TCS Software Component Interface <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/LTS-307>`_ and there is no detailed state defined in MTAOS.
The `eups <https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/eups>`_ is used as the package manager.
